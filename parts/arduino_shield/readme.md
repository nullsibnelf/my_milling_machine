<p>&nbsp;</p>


- It is designed to fit on an Arduino Uno.    
- As stepper drivers I've chosen watterott's TMC2130 board. The board supports 3 Axis: X, Y and Z.    
- For better connectivity I added a HC-05 bluetooth-module. Baudrate stays at 115.200.    
- The shield hat 2 supply inputs: 5V for logic and the Arduino-board, and 12V for the steppers and the ESC/brushless motor.
